# NOTES: 
* Using latest version of Cypress (6.1)
* Ran into random issue on Chrome(87) where Cypress failed to finish typing string in text boxes before moving to the next field
* Seems stable on Firefox
* I did not invest time into troubleshooting
* See related bug: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5480
